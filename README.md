# crib-sheets

The purposes of this repo are:
* To collect useful snippets of code, the sort of things that have to be looked up on StackOverflow once every 6 months.
* To store gist equivalent files, rather than having to navigate to gist.github.com
* To store study notes when learning new tech

Files are written in Markdown, likely best viewed using e.g. Atom
